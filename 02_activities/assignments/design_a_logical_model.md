# Assignment 1: Design a Logical Model

## Question 1
Create a logical model for a small bookstore. 📚

At the minimum it should have employee, order, sales, customer, and book entities (tables). Determine sensible column and table design based on what you know about these concepts. Keep it simple, but work out sensible relationships to keep tables reasonably sized. Include a date table. There are several tools online you can use, I'd recommend [_Draw.io_](https://www.drawio.com/) or [_LucidChart_](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/).

## Question 2
We want to create employee shifts, splitting up the day into morning and evening. Add this to the ERD.

## Question 3
The store wants to keep customer addresses. Propose two architectures for the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table, one that will retain changes, and another that will overwrite. Which is type 1, which is type 2?

_Hint, search type 1 vs type 2 slowly changing dimensions._

Bonus: Are there privacy implications to this, why or why not?
```
Your answer...
If the store is considering how to store customer addresses in a CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table I will propose these two Architectures:

Retaining Address Changes:
In this approach, the system retains a history of all addresses associated with a customer. A new record is created each time the address changes, and the old records are kept. This is called Slowly Changing Dimension Type 2 (SCD Type 2).
Behavior: Each time a customer updates their address, a new record is inserted into the table, with a new start date and the old record marked as "inactive" by setting the end date and updating the is_current flag.

Overwriting Address:
In this approach, the address is simply overwritten each time a change occurs. The table would store only the latest address for each customer. This is called Slowly Changing Dimension Type 1 (SCD Type 1).
Behavior: When the customer updates their address, the system overwrites the existing address information. There is no historical record of previous addresses.
```

## Question 4
Review the AdventureWorks Schema [here](https://imgur.com/a/u0m8fX6)

Highlight at least two differences between it and your ERD. Would you change anything in yours?
```
Your answer...

In AdventureWorks Schema the level is Physical and technical database representation while in the ERD its Conceptual representation of data relationships
In AdventureWorks Schema the format is SQL-based or detailed diagram with table definitions while the ERD is Abstract graphical diagram (rectangles, lines)
In AdventureWorks Schema the purpose is Data types, constraints, indexes, primary/foreign keys while the ERD purpose is Entities, relationships, cardinality, attributes
