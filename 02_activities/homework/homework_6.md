**Write**: 

Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

Reflecting on my previous role as a Business Analyst at Altus Group, I recognize the vital importance of incorporating ethical considerations and addressing inequities within business analysis practices. The experiences I garnered while analyzing market data and developing solutions to improve business processes have underscored the potential impact of these elements on decision-making and project outcomes.
During my tenure at Altus Group, my focus was predominantly on optimizing efficiency and accuracy in data management and analysis, which directly influenced strategic decisions and operational improvements. However, integrating an ethical framework and an awareness of equity could have further enhanced the sustainability and social responsibility of our projects. For instance, in conducting market analyses or forecasting trends, an ethical approach would involve not only rigorous data integrity but also considering the data's implications on various stakeholder groups, including potentially marginalized communities. This would ensure that our business strategies do not inadvertently perpetuate existing disparities or biases.
Adjusting my approach to include ethics and inequity components would involve several strategic shifts. First, I would advocate for and implement the use of ethical guidelines in data collection, analysis, and usage that respect privacy, consent, and transparency, especially in how data about individuals and communities is gathered and utilized. This might include more stringent measures to anonymize data or more scrutiny of how data collection practices could impact various groups differently.
Secondly, recognizing and actively addressing inequities would require a conscious effort to understand who benefits from or is harmed by certain business decisions. This could be integrated into the business analysis process by incorporating equity impact assessments, like environmental impact assessments, in the planning and evaluation stages of all major projects. These assessments would help identify potential negative consequences for underrepresented groups and allow for the development of mitigation strategies.
Finally, fostering an organizational culture that values diverse perspectives, and inclusive practices would be crucial. This involves training and development opportunities that sensitize team members to the nuances of ethical and equitable decision-making and encouraging diverse teams that can offer a broader range of insights into how decisions might play out across different demographic groups.
By integrating these components into my business analysis practice, I would not only contribute to more ethically sound and equitable business practices at my next place of work but also set a standard for responsibility that could influence the broader industry.
